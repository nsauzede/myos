MyOS : a simple, self-teaching operating system.
Copyright (C) Nicolas Sauzede 2009

Written to learn operating systems implementation.

Basically composed of x86 code, comprising a bootloader and a kernel.

The main target is emulation via qemu, as a bios rom extension or a 
bootable floppy disk image.
But it should run as well on a real machine.

-the loader is a nasm x86 assembly code, managing 16/32 bit kernels.
-the 16 bit kernel is pure nasm 16 bit code
-the 32 bit kernel is plain ANSI C code, running in 32 bit protected mode,
with one small gas assembly boot code.

See doc/specs.txt for more technical details / general low level OS infos.
