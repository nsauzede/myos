If you have qemu PC emulator installed, you can test MyOS quickly
at the project root directory :

-test 16 bit kernel as a floppy
make clean check16

-test 16 bit kernel as a rom extension
make clean check16r

-test 32 bit kernel as a floppy
make clean check32

-test 32 bit kernel as a rom extension
make clean check32r

-test 64 bit kernel as a floppy
make clean check64

-test 64 bit kernel as a rom extension
make clean check64r


-to compile everything, ie: 16/32/64 bit kernels, as floppy/rom extension :

make clean all



Output files description :

fd*.img			: 16/32/64 bit kernel as a bootable floppy disk image
romext*.rom		: 16/32/64 bit kernel as a bios rom extension

*.img files may be written to a real floppy disk (1.44MiB format)
and booted on a real machine, or with an emulator (see above)
*.rom files may be written to a physical EEPROM (such as eg: 2764)
plugged to some network card with a rom extension socket and booted
on a real machine, or with an emulator (see above)
